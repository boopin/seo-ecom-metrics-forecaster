## How It Works

1. **CTR Model**: Estimates traffic based on search position using industry-standard CTR curves ("Default", "E-commerce", "Informational") or user-defined custom CTRs with realistic defaults (e.g., 30% for position 1, decreasing to 0.5% beyond 10)
2. **SERP Adjustments**: Modifies CTRs for featured snippets (e.g., +10% if your site is in it, -20% if not) and FAQs (+10% if included, -10% if not), with manual control for custom CTRs
3. **Growth Model**: Uses a sigmoid function to model realistic SEO improvement over time
4. **Seasonality**: Applies category-specific seasonal multipliers for each month
5. **Conversion Modeling**: Calculates conversions and revenue based on user-defined rates
6. **ROI Calculation**: Computes return on investment metrics including initial costs

## Input File Format

The tool accepts CSV and Excel files with the following columns:
- **Keyword**: The search term (also accepts "term", "query", "search term")
- **Search Volume**: Monthly searches (also accepts "volume", "monthly searches")
- **Current Position**: Current ranking (also accepts "rank", "ranking", "position")
- **Target Position (optional)**: Desired ranking position
- **Keyword Difficulty (optional)**: Difficulty score (1-10)

## Example

For a dataset of BBQ-related keywords:
1. Upload your keywords from a SEMrush export
2. Select "BBQ & Outdoor Cooking" as the category
3. Set projection period to 6 months
4. Enter your site's conversion rate (e.g., 3%)
5. Set average order value (e.g., Â£250)
6. Choose "Custom" CTR model and adjust values (e.g., Position 1: 25, Position 2: 15, Position 3: 10, beyond 10: 0.5)
7. Check "Featured Snippet Present" and "My site is in the Featured Snippet" for relevant keywords
8. Click "Calculate Forecast"

The tool will show you expected traffic, conversion, and revenue improvements over the next 6 months, factoring in summer peak seasonality for BBQ products, custom CTRs, and a CTR boost from the featured snippet.
