st.header("What Can This Tool Do?")
st.markdown("""
- **Forecast SEO Performance**: Predict how improving your search engine rankings for specific keywords will impact your website traffic, conversions, and revenue over a 6 or 12-month period.
- **Keyword Analysis**: Analyze individual keywords to see their current traffic, potential traffic gains, and revenue impact based on target ranking positions.
- **Break-Even Analysis**: Determine how long it will take to recover your SEO investment (implementation cost) based on projected revenue gains.
- **What-If Analysis**: Experiment with different conversion rates to understand how they affect your forecast.
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Account for seasonal trends in your industry (e.g., BBQ sales peak in summer, Christmas products peak in winter).
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provide 95% confidence intervals for traffic, conversion, and revenue forecasts to account for uncertainty in click-through rates.
- **Export Results**: Download your forecast results as a CSV file for further analysis.

# What Can This Tool Not Do?
st.header("What Can This Tool Not Do?")
st.markdown("""
- **Guarantee Results**: The forecasts are based on assumptions (e.g., click-through rates, conversion rates, average order value) and simplified models. Actual SEO outcomes depend on many factors, including competition, algorithm changes, and execution quality.
- **Replace SEO Expertise**: This tool provides estimates to guide your strategy, but it does not replace the need for professional SEO knowledge and implementation.
- **Account for All Variables**: The tool does not consider external factors like changes in search volume, competitor actions, or Google algorithm updates.
- **Provide Real-Time Data**: Forecasts are based on the data you input (e.g., search volume, current position). The tool does not fetch live data from search engines.
- **Optimize Keywords for You**: While it helps you analyze keywords, it does not suggest or optimize keywordsâ€”you need to provide the keywords and their data.

st.markdown("""
If you're new to tools like this or not familiar with SEO, donâ€™t worry! Weâ€™ll guide you through the basics to get started with EcomSEO Predictor. Follow these simple steps to see how improving your websiteâ€™s search rankings can help your online store.

1. **Open the Tool**:
   - Youâ€™re already on the right page! Look at the sidebar on the left side of the screen. Click on **"Home"** to go to the main tool. It will say "EcomSEO Predictor - Main App" at the top.

2. **Tell the Tool About Your Business**:
   - On the left sidebar, youâ€™ll see a section called **"Settings"**. These are the basic details the tool needs to make predictions for your store:
     - **Product Category**: Choose the type of products you sell (e.g., "Fashion & Apparel" if you sell clothes, or "BBQ & Outdoor Cooking" if you sell grills).
     - **Currency**: Pick the currency you use for your store (e.g., "USD ($)" for US dollars).
     - **Average Order Value**: Enter the average amount a customer spends when they buy from you. For example, if a typical order is $50, type "50".
     - **Implementation Cost**: This is how much you plan to spend on improving your websiteâ€™s search rankings (e.g., hiring someone to help with SEO). If youâ€™re not sure, you can leave it at $5000 for now.
   - Donâ€™t worry about the other settings for nowâ€”theyâ€™re already set to good defaults!

3. **Add Your Keywords**:
   - Keywords are the words people type into Google to find your products, like "buy summer dress" or "best BBQ grill".
   - Scroll down to the section called **"Keywords"**. Youâ€™ll see a table with some example keywords like "gas bbq".
   - To add your own keywords:
     - Click on the box that says **"Add New Keyword"** to open it.
     - Fill in the details:
       - **Keyword**: Type the search term (e.g., "summer dress").
       - **Search Volume**: This is how many people search for this term each month. If you donâ€™t know, you can guess for now (e.g., 1000).
       - **Current Position**: Where your website shows up in Google for this term (e.g., if youâ€™re on the second page, it might be 15). If youâ€™re not sure, leave it at 10.
       - **Target Position**: Where youâ€™d like to show up (e.g., 3 to be near the top of the first page).
       - **Keyword Difficulty**: How hard it is to rank for this term (1 is easy, 10 is hard). If youâ€™re not sure, leave it at 5.
     - Click the **"Add Keyword"** button to add it to the table.
   - You can add as many keywords as you like!

4. **Run Your Prediction**:
   - Once youâ€™ve added at least one keyword, scroll down and find the big blue button that says **"Calculate Forecast"**.
   - Click this button, and the tool will show you how much extra traffic, sales, and revenue you might get by improving your search rankings.

5. **Look at Your Results**:
   - After clicking "Calculate Forecast", youâ€™ll see a few sections:
     - **Forecast Results**: This shows the total extra visitors, sales, and money you might make.
     - **Break-Even Analysis**: This tells you how long it will take to make back the money you spend on SEO.
     - **Keyword Details**: This shows how each keyword you added will help your store.
   - Donâ€™t worry if some numbers look complicatedâ€”the main ones to look at are the "Total Traffic Gain" (more visitors), "Total Conversion Gain" (more sales), and "Total Revenue Gain" (more money).

6. **Whatâ€™s Next?**:
   - If you like the results, you can start working on your SEO to improve your rankings for those keywords.
   - If youâ€™re not sure what to do next, you can reach out to an SEO expert for help. You can also download your results by clicking **"Download Results as CSV"** at the bottom of the "Keyword Details" section to share with someone who can help.
