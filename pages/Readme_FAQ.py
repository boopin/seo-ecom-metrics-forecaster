# What Can This Tool Not Do?
st.header("What Can This Tool Not Do?")
st.markdown("""
- **Guarantee Results**: The forecasts are based on assumptions (e.g., click-through rates, conversion rates, average order value) and simplified models. Actual SEO outcomes depend on many factors, including competition, algorithm changes, and execution quality.
- **Replace SEO Expertise**: This tool provides estimates to guide your strategy, but it does not replace the need for professional SEO knowledge and implementation.
- **Account for All Variables**: The tool does not consider external factors like changes in search volume, competitor actions, or Google algorithm updates.
- **Provide Real-Time Data**: Forecasts are based on the data you input (e.g., search volume, current position). The tool does not fetch live data from search engines.
- **Optimize Keywords for You**: While it helps you analyze keywords, it does not suggest or optimize keywordsâ€”you need to provide the keywords and their data.

st.markdown("""
If you're new to tools like this or not familiar with SEO, donâ€™t worry! Weâ€™ll guide you through the basics to get started with EcomSEO Predictor. Follow these simple steps to see how improving your websiteâ€™s search rankings can help your online store.

1. **Open the Tool**:
   - Youâ€™re already on the right page! Look at the sidebar on the left side of the screen. Click on **"Home"** to go to the main tool. It will say "EcomSEO Predictor - Main App" at the top.

2. **Tell the Tool About Your Business**:
   - On the left sidebar, youâ€™ll see a section called **"Settings"**. These are the basic details the tool needs to make predictions for your store:
     - **Product Category**: Choose the type of products you sell (e.g., "Fashion & Apparel" if you sell clothes, or "BBQ & Outdoor Cooking" if you sell grills).
     - **Currency**: Pick the currency you use for your store (e.g., "USD ($)" for US dollars).
     - **Average Order Value**: Enter the average amount a customer spends when they buy from you. For example, if a typical order is $50, type "50".
     - **Implementation Cost**: This is how much you plan to spend on improving your websiteâ€™s search rankings (e.g., hiring someone to help with SEO). If youâ€™re not sure, you can leave it at $5000 for now.
   - Donâ€™t worry about the other settings for nowâ€”theyâ€™re already set to good defaults!

3. **Add Your Keywords**:
   - Keywords are the words people type into Google to find your products, like "buy summer dress" or "best BBQ grill".
   - Scroll down to the section called **"Keywords"**. Youâ€™ll see a table with some example keywords like "gas bbq".
   - To add your own keywords:
     - Click on the box that says **"Add New Keyword"** to open it.
     - Fill in the details:
       - **Keyword**: Type the search term (e.g., "summer dress").
       - **Search Volume**: This is how many people search for this term each month. If you donâ€™t know, you can guess for now (e.g., 1000).
       - **Current Position**: Where your website shows up in Google for this term (e.g., if youâ€™re on the second page, it might be 15). If youâ€™re not sure, leave it at 10.
       - **Target Position**: Where youâ€™d like to show up (e.g., 3 to be near the top of the first page).
       - **Keyword Difficulty**: How hard it is to rank for this term (1 is easy, 10 is hard). If youâ€™re not sure, leave it at 5.
     - Click the **"Add Keyword"** button to add it to the table.
   - You can add as many keywords as you like!

4. **Run Your Prediction**:
   - Once youâ€™ve added at least one keyword, scroll down and find the big blue button that says **"Calculate Forecast"**.
   - Click this button, and the tool will show you how much extra traffic, sales, and revenue you might get by improving your search rankings.

5. **Look at Your Results**:
   - After clicking "Calculate Forecast", youâ€™ll see a few sections:
     - **Forecast Results**: This shows the total extra visitors, sales, and money you might make.
     - **Break-Even Analysis**: This tells you how long it will take to make back the money you spend on SEO.
     - **Keyword Details**: This shows how each keyword you added will help your store.
   - Donâ€™t worry if some numbers look complicatedâ€”the main ones to look at are the "Total Traffic Gain" (more visitors), "Total Conversion Gain" (more sales), and "Total Revenue Gain" (more money).

6. **Whatâ€™s Next?**:
   - If you like the results, you can start working on your SEO to improve your rankings for those keywords.
   - If youâ€™re not sure what to do next, you can reach out to an SEO expert for help. You can also download your results by clicking **"Download Results as CSV"** at the bottom of the "Keyword Details" section to share with someone who can help.

# Frequently Asked Questions
st.header("Frequently Asked Questions")
st.markdown("""
Here are answers to some common questions about EcomSEO Predictor:

**How does the tool account for the impact of ads and organic features like listings, FAQs, or featured snippets on CTR?**

When someone searches on Google, the results page often includes ads at the top, along with features like product listings, FAQs, or featured snippets (a box with a quick answer). These can affect how many people click on your website, even if you rank in a good position. This percentage of clicks is called the Click-Through Rate (CTR).

Hereâ€™s how EcomSEO Predictor handles this:
- The tool uses preset "CTR models" to estimate how many people will click on your website based on its position in search results. We have three models: "Default", "E-commerce", and "Informational". Each model is based on average data from many search results and reflects typical click rates for different types of searches.
- For example, the "E-commerce" model assumes more people click on top results because product searches often have ads and listings (e.g., 30% for position 1), while the "Informational" model assumes higher clicks for content-focused searches (like blog posts, e.g., 35% for position 1) but a faster drop-off for lower positions.
- You can choose the model that best matches your business in the "Settings" section (under "CTR Model"). If your products show up in searches with lots of ads or listings (like "buy summer dress"), the "E-commerce" model might be a better fit.
- **SERP Features Adjustments**: In the sidebar under "SERP Features Adjustments", you can check boxes if your keywords have a "Featured Snippet Present" or "FAQ Present". If your site is in these features (e.g., "My site is in the Featured Snippet"), the tool increases your CTR by 10%. If not, it lowers it slightly (e.g., 20% decrease for position 1 if a featured snippet is present but not yours). This helps account for how these features might steal or boost clicks.
- **Limitations**: The tool doesnâ€™t look at the actual search results page for your keywords, so it canâ€™t adjust for specific ads or features beyond these general rules. This would require live data from Google, which the tool doesnâ€™t have access to.
- **What You Can Do**: Pick the CTR model that best fits your industry. If you know your keywords often have ads or special features at the top, you might expect slightly lower clicks than the tool predicts, especially for positions 1-3. You can also use the "What-If Analysis" to test different scenarios and see how changes in clicks might affect your results.

**What are Custom CTR inputs, and how do I use them?**

The "Custom" CTR model lets you set your own click-through rates for each search position (1-10 and beyond 10) instead of using the preset models. This is useful if you have specific data about how many people click on your site from search results.

- **How to Use It**: In the sidebar under "Settings", select "CTR Model" as "Custom". Youâ€™ll see a section called "Custom CTR Values (%)" where you can enter percentages for positions 1 through 10 and a value for positions beyond 10.
- **Default Values**: By default, these are set to realistic numbers based on e-commerce trends (e.g., Position 1: 30%, Position 2: 20%, down to Position 10: 1%, and beyond 10: 0.5%). These are percentages, so 0.2 means 20%â€”for example, if 100 people search, 20 will click.
- **Example**: If you know from your analytics that only 15% of people click your site when itâ€™s in position 1 (instead of the default 30%), you can change "Pos 1" to 15. If position 5 gets 8% clicks, set "Pos 5" to 8, and so on.
- **Why Use It**: This is great if you have data from tools like Google Search Console showing your actual CTRs, or if your industry has unique click patterns the preset models donâ€™t match.
- **Tip**: Enter values as percentages (e.g., 20 for 20%), and the tool will convert them to decimals (e.g., 0.2) for calculations. Make sure they decrease as positions go lowerâ€”higher positions should have higher CTRs.

**How do the SERP feature adjustments work with Custom CTR inputs?**

When you use the "Custom" CTR model, the SERP feature adjustments (like featured snippets or FAQs) donâ€™t automatically apply because youâ€™re setting your own rates. Hereâ€™s how it works:
- **Custom CTR Only**: If you set a custom CTR (e.g., Position 1: 25%), the tool uses that exact value and doesnâ€™t adjust it for featured snippets or FAQs. This assumes your custom numbers already account for any SERP features.
- **Adding Adjustments**: If you want adjustments, youâ€™ll need to factor them into your custom values yourself. For example, if position 1 normally gets 25% but youâ€™re in a featured snippet (which might boost it by 10%), you could manually set "Pos 1" to 27.5 (25 * 1.1). If youâ€™re not in the snippet and it lowers clicks by 20%, set it to 20 (25 * 0.8).
- **Why This Way**: This gives you full control, but it means you need to know how features affect your clicks and adjust accordingly.
- **Switching Models**: If you want the tool to handle SERP adjustments automatically, use a preset model like "E-commerce" instead of "Custom".
